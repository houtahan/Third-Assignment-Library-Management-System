The main purpose of this assignment was to completely understand the classes and their relations with each other.
there are 5 main classes in this code and they are used to launch the menus, the functions, the methods, ...
In the book class we mainly focus on the attributes of the books and the getter and setter.
In the librarian class we focus on the getter and setters related to the librarian.
In the library class we code most of the important functions which are book, user, librarian related and we use them
all throughout the project.
In the main class we code all the menus which are the main menu, the user manu and the librarian menu and in the User
class we code the getter and setters related to the user and two functions for the user which are borrow and return
the book.
the most challenging part of the project was handling the relations of the classes and not using the functions in a
wrong way.
Most of the bugs encountered were because of the usage of functions that are in other classes and how to use those functions
in another class correctly.
This project was a great assignment to learn and study the classes and use them in even bigger projects.
